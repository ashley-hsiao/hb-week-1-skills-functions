# SOLUTIONS!

################################################################
# PART ONE


# 1. Write a function that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

def print_hello_world():
    print "Hello World"


# 2. Write a function that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.

def user_greeting(name):
    print "Hi {}".format(name)


# 3. Write a function that takes two integers and multiplies
#    them together. Print the result.

def mult_two_nums(x, y):
    return x * y


# 4. Write a function that takes a string and an integer and
#    prints the string that many times

def string_multipler(string, n):
    print string * n


# 5. Write a function that takes an integer and prints "Higher
#    than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower
#    than zero. If integer is 0 print "Zero".

def number_greater_than_zero(num):
    if num > 0:
        print "Higher than 0"
    elif num < 0:
        print "Lower than 0"
    else:
        print "Zero"


# 6. Write a function that takes an integer and returns a
#    boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number
#    is evenly divisible by 3.

def is_divisible_by_3(num):
    return num % 3 == 0


# 7. Write a function that takes a sentence as one string and
#    returns the number of spaces.

def number_of_spaces(sentence):
    count = 0

    for char in sentence:
        if char == " ":
            count += 1

    return count


# 8. Write a function that can be passed a meal price and a
#    tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip
#    percentage should be optional; if not given, it should
#    default to 15%.

# Assumes user puts in whole number for percentage, not decimal. Therefore tip is floated and divided by 100.

def calculate_meal(price, tip=15):
    return price + price * (float(tip)/100)


# 9. Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and
#    returns two pieces of information as strings ---
#    "Positive" or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings
#	 should be returned in a list.
#
# 	Then, write code that shows the calling of this function
# 	on a number and unpack what is returned into two
# 	variables --- sign and parity (whether it's positive
# 	or negative). Print sign and parity.

def integer_info(num):
    sign = None
    parity = None

    if num > 0:
        sign = "Positive"
    else:
        sign = "Negative"

    if num % 2 == 0:
        parity = "Even"
    else:
        parity = "Odd"

    return [sign, parity]


sign, parity = integer_info(32)
print sign
print parity

# PART TWO


# 1. We have some code which is meant to calculate an item cost
#    by adding tax. Tax is normally 5% but it's higher in
#    California (7%).
#
#    Turn this into a function. Your function will pass in
#    the default tax amount (5%), a state abbreviaton, and the
#    default tax amount as parameters.
#    If the state is California, apply a 7% tax within the function.
#    Your function should return the total cost of the item including tax.

# Assumes user puts in whole number for percentage, not decimal. Therefore tax is floated and divided by 100.


def calculate_item_cost(cost, state, tax=5):
    if state == "CA":
        tax = 7

    return cost + cost * (float(tax)/100)


# 2. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function.
#	 Take a name and a job title as parameters, making it so the
# 	 job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed in.
#	 Return the person's title and name.

def print_name_title(name, job_title="Engineer"):
    # Use string formatting so that output is not a string
    return "{} {}".format(job_title, name)


# 3. Given a receiver's name, receiver's job title, and sender's name, print the following letter:
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECEIVER_NAME, I think you are amazing! Sincerely,
#       SENDER_NAME.
#    Use the function from #2 to construct the full title for the letter's greeting.

def print_letter(name, job_title, sender_name):
    full_title = print_name_title(name, job_title)
    print "Dear {}, I think you are amazing! Sincerely, {}.".format(full_title, sender_name)

# Error occurs when user does not pass through a job title as an argument - print_letter() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given), although print_name_title() would default job_title to "Engineer" if not passed through - Figure this out later.


# 4. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function. This
#    function will take a number and append it to *numbers*. It doesn't
#    need to return anything.

# Not sure what this question really means. Is *numbers* supposed to be a list that this function keeps adding to?

numbers = []


def append_to_numbers(num):
    numbers.append(num)
